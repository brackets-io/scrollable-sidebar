# scrollable-sidebar
BRACKETS: Taller Working Files + ability to scroll past them to get to Project selector and Project Files.

Makes entire scrollbar scrollable as one unit. If you use Taller Working Files extension and have lots of Working Files open the Project selector box and Project Files can dissapear off the bottom of the screen. This amateurish extension attempts to solve that. Only tested on Windows. Breaks sidebar resizing and "show in file tree". Please improve if you know how. Based on Taller Working Files.
